## [1.1.3](https://github.com/edgemesh/edgemesh/release/1.1.3) (11-8-2016)

## [1.1.2](https://github.com/edgemesh/edgemesh/release/1.1.2) (11-8-2016)

> Performance tuning and various bug fixes.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed bug where handshake time was not being recorded correctly

<a name="1.1.1"></a>
## [1.1.1](https://github.com/edgemesh/edgemesh/release/1.1.1) (11-5-2016)

> After running on our own site and pushing updates, we realized it's a real pain to have to update the `edgemesh.client.min.js` script every time it's updated (could be often).
> If you start edgemesh with no `client` option, you will always get the latest version of edgemesh.  The only time you will have to manually (via cli) update a file is when the service worker changes.
> The service worker will rarely need updating, but when it does it will be denoted by a major patch bump.  

### Bugfixes
- Added a deadman's switch to the initial webrtc connection
- Set up graceful handling of `SIGTERM`, `SIGINT`, `SIGHUP` and `unexpectedError`

### Chores

- Expand configuration options
- Update `README.md`
